go</h2>

<p>I recently have been working improving my ability to quickly prototype projects from the ground up. I feel like in my day to day work I am frequently working on very large established systems. Where slow steady progress and refactoring are king. Working on smaller apps to try out new ideas and development methods can be a fun and educational habit. I built this app initially very quickly to solve a problem of my own. I have then expanded it a bit to build out out a app that might be useful for some to some other people.</p>

<p>The result is a tiny app, <a href='http://blog2ebook.herokuapp.com/'>Blog2Ebook</a></p>

<h2 id='what_does_it_do'>What does it do?</h2>

<p>Blog2Ebook supports importing from 3 different formats to make a Kindle book:</p>

<ul>
<li>RSS feed to Kindle</li>

<li>Single post to Kindle (useful because some https sites no longer allow bookmarklets)</li>

<li>Copied article text to Kindle</li>
</ul>

<p>You might be thinking there are tons of solutions for this. Like <a href='http://www.readability.com/'>Readability</a> and <a href='http://www.amazon.com/gp/sendtokindle'>Amazon&#8217;s send to Kindle</a>. True but each seem to have some problems and is missing something I want.</p>

<ul>
<li>Nothing seems to fetch &amp; format a full blog the way I want.</li>

<li>Readability is mostly setup for single articles as a bookmarklet, but the newer JS restrictions on some https sites like github prevent the bookmarklet from working</li>

<li>Amazon allows you to email files to the Kindle, but sometimes you just want to paste some text. You have to create and attach a text file to the email opposed to just having the email body be the content.</li>
</ul>

<p>So I built a little app and learned a ton about eBook formatting, publishing, and various eBook formats. I think I might want to self publish something in the future and this has prepared me with some knowledge of the self publishing problems and process.</p>

<p>Supporting very simple eBook publishing of a full blog with all content is the primary goal of the project. The other features are secondary and basically around because they were easy to add on and solved some problems. At this point I am starting to look a bit more into how to best format the content and embed related content into the books.</p>

<h2 id='app_details_and_resources'>App details and Resources</h2>

<p>You can find the project Blog2Book, <a href='http://blog2ebook.herokuapp.com/'>convert an RSS feed to Kindle eBook</a>, hosted on <a href='http://heroku.com'>Heroku</a>.</p>

<p>The source code is available on github, as <a href='https://github.com/danmayer/blog2ebook'>Blog2Ebook is open source</a></p>

<p>If you have thoughts, problems, or ideas <a href='https://github.com/danmayer/blog2ebook/issues'>send feedback to issues</a> for the project.</p>

<h2 id='technologies_used'>Technologies Used</h2>

<p>I will likely post a bit more about the development process and specific examples of tech usage in another post, but I wanted to provide some details on the tech supporting the project.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Built using <a href='https://github.com/danmayer/sinatra_template'>Sinatra Template</a>, a personal project I maintain to quickly bootstrap small Sinatra projects. I will describe it more in a future post, but it makes it easy to get up and running with a web or API project using Sinatra and the gems and features I am experienced using.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Single Article Publishing, document content parsing</p>

<ul>
<li><a href='http://www.readability.com/'>Readability&#8217;s Api</a> to better support single article publishing</li>

<li>I also checked out <a href='https://github.com/peterc/pismo'>Pismo</a> and <a href='https://github.com/cantino/ruby-readability'>Ruby Readability</a> which is a Port of arc90&#8217;s readability project to ruby. In the end single article support most often uses Readability&#8217;s API as I found it gave the best results.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p><a href='http://redis-cloud.com'>Redis Cloud by Garantia Data</a> A awesome cloud redis provider</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><a href='http://www.mailgun.com/'>Mailgun</a> to power email, which is the kindle delivery mechanism.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>RSS feed processing was done with <a href='https://github.com/rest-client/rest-client'>rest-client</a> and <a href='http://nokogiri.org/'>nokogiri</a></p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Amazon&#8217;s <a href='http://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?ie=UTF8&amp;docId=1000765211'>KindleGen</a> to package up HTML content into .mobi files. Which allows packaging images in with the content as well as embedding book meta data. (mobi support with images is on a work in progress branch on not live yet)</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Because this is using the free tier of some of the supporting services, I limited daily usage of the app to below the free tier limits. So please be kind to the service, if it starts to run out of capacity I will take a look at expanding it out.</p><mbp:pagebreak /><br/><hr/><a name='chap2' /><h3><a href='http://mayerdan.com/ruby/2013/06/02/quick-application-diagrams-with-yard'>Quick Application Diagrams with Yard</a></h3><div>updated: 06/02/2013 at 12:00AM</div><br/><p>Thanks to following awesome people on twitter I learned something I didn&#8217;t know about yard. That is can be used to create nice application diagrams. I saw a tweet from <a href='https://twitter.com/merbist/status/336417811079495681'>Matt Aimonetti</a>, about generating diagrams with yard. I was interested in trying it out myself. After quickly installing <a href='http://www.graphviz.org/'>graphviz</a> which I apparently no longer had on my machine, I was rewarded with some nice diagrams for my rails apps. It also works well for gems as you can see from the churn graph below. Unfortunately it doesn&#8217;t seem to work completely out of the box on Sinatra apps, so I might need to learn a bit more configuration.</p>

<pre><code>brew install graphviz
gem install yard
yard -n
yard graph --dependencies | dot -Tpdf -o app_diagram.pdf</code></pre>

<p>Above was all that was needed to get rails app diagrams like those below.</p>

<p>Churn</p>

<p>This post explains how I quickly get an application started for Rails 3.2.x.The post is part of a series covering quickly prototyping projects.</p>

<p>When I start a new rails project, I want to quickly get going with a login system, admin and other user roles, a nice default app template / style, and a JS framework I can build on. After looking at several options I ended up going with <a href='http://railsapps.github.io/rails-composer/'>Rails Composer</a>. It has a number of packages that work out of the box. It is very configurable, it is very easy to get up and running. <a href='https://railsapps.org'>Railsapps</a> used to have a lot of free tutorials coving using rails-composer, now they <a href='https://tutorials.railsapps.org/'>sell detailed tutorials to support their work</a>. You can still generally just read the read me for a project and go through the basic options to get everything working. I generally follow the <a href='https://github.com/RailsApps/rails3-bootstrap-devise-cancan'>Rails App for Devise with CanCan and Twitter Bootstrap</a> example for my basic app base and further configure it myself from there.</p>

<h2 id='why_use_rails_composer'>Why use Rails composer?</h2>

<p>Starting a brand new app takes time and a lot of the initial configuration is very much the same. The composer options I choose are well understood common Rails gems I would often choose for my initial setup in the first place. I understand all the pieces that I setup with Rails composer so I don&#8217;t feel like I am giving up any understanding by starting with the generated app. I would recommend making sure you &#8216;could&#8217; setup any of the pieces Rails composer configures for you, and understanding them before using them in a generated project. If I am programming in my personal time I often have a problem I want to solve or a specific idea I want to test, getting to the point I can work on the primary focus with little lost has a big value to me.</p>

<p>If I choose Rails over Sinatra for a web project, in part I am assuming I will have higher front end needs for the project. Which likely means I will have accounts, logins, roles / rights, and want a more polished look and feel. Out of the box Rails requires you to setup a lot just to meet those basic needs. With Rails composer, I am basically good to go.</p>

<ul>
<li>A solid starting design, Rails composer will give me <a href='http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/'>Twitter Bootstrap</a> configured and ready to go out of the gate</li>

<li>I am setup to perform most of my basic JS needs via Jquery which is ready to go from the beginning</li>

<li>Accounts, roles, and rights are covered by : Devise, Cancan, and Rolify. Quickly covering my basic account management needs.</li>

<li>The composer setups up a great way to share application specific configuration that isn&#8217;t checked into the code repo via <a href='https://github.com/laserlemon/figaro'>Figaro</a>. Which also supposed publishing the environment to Heroku my preferred production deployment for personal projects.</li>

<li>Having a nice familiar base app as a starting point helps me more quickly get to building application specific pieces of code and get my idea out there. Using a normal configuration with gems I am familiar with.</li>

<li>Stand on the shoulders of giants, I don&#8217;t want to spend my time building yet another authentication system, building in features like forgot password, email confirmation, etc.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id='nothing_to_development_with_rails_composer'>Nothing to development with Rails composer</h2>

<p>The example below is creating a new application called nothingcalendar2, which is a new version of a app I created awhile ago called nothing calendar to try out some JS ideas. Now I want to convert it to a modern rails application and add some new features.</p>

<pre><code>rvm use ruby-1.9.3

#this will ask you some configuration options
rails new nothingcalendar2 -m https://raw.github.com/RailsApps/rails-composer/master/composer.rb

cd nothingcalendar2
bunlde install --local
bundle exec rake db:create
bundle exec rake db:migrate

#set the data to match your accounts / info
open config/application.yml

#this will use the data set in the last step to create accounts in the dev DB
bundle exec rake db:seed

# You have a app
rails s
open http://localhost:3000/

# check the tests
bundle exec rake

#create a new repo
https://github.com/new
git remote add origin git@github.com:danmayer/nothingcalendar2.git
git push -u origin master</code></pre>

<h2 id='from_development_to_production'>From development to production</h2>

<p>Great we have a app how do we get it out there for the world to see? For personal projects I mostly deploy initially to Heroku and only move to a larger more real production environment if the project really demands it. Getting a basic app to Heroku is easy. Obviously in the instructions below you need to name your app something else.</p>

<pre><code>heroku apps:create nothingcalendar2

#edit Gemfile
#add the group option to sqlite3 as you don&#39;t want it to install on heroku
#set group to development and test
#you could use postgres locally since that is what you are using on heroku in production. That is the recommended setup but for a toy project many people don&#39;t have postgres locally
gem &#39;sqlite3&#39;, :group =&gt; [:development, :test]
#add postgres to Gemfile only for production group
gem &#39;pg&#39;, :group =&gt; [:production]
bundle install

git push heroku master
heroku run rake db:migrate
#push the settings in your config/application.yml to heroku
bundle exec rake figaro:heroku
#seed the database with admin account
heroku run rake db:seed

#you should be live
open http://nothingcalendar2.herokuapp.com/</code></pre>

<h2 id='rails_from_nothing_to_production'>Rails from nothing to production</h2>

<p>Following the steps above it how I start most of my rails apps these days. Getting me up and running very quickly so that I can focus on the goals at hand and not worry about some of the initial details of having a basic infrastructure to build on. I have used this on a couple projects now and I am pretty happy with the process. I will likely continue to use this to quickly test out ideas, although for many simple progress I prefer the even lighter weight Sinatra setup, but that is for another post.</p>

<p>I think this is a great way to get going. Not everyone agrees with me for the opposing view checkout, <a href='http://thunderboltlabs.com/posts/why-we-dont-use-a-rails-template.html'>Why we don&#8217;t use a Rails template</a> by <a href='http://thunderboltlabs.com/'>thunderboltlabs</a>.</p>

I have always found that true. In part because if there is a hard problem without a clean solution it is easier to make a mistake. Another reasons is one bug results in one hack with a bad fix adding it&#8217;s own bug. <strong>Creating bugs all the way down</strong>. I think devs in general know about the issue of bugs clustering, but I don&#8217;t think everyone knows what to do about it or that it doesn&#8217;t only apply to bugs.</p>

<h3 id='ok_bugs_cluster_now_what'>OK, bugs cluster now what?</h3>

<p>Depending on the on the seriousness of the bug, likelihood of a one off mistake or potential cluster, there are a couple of different things that might be worth doing:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>For any bug it is worth at least doing a brief audit to see if there are similar mistakes in nearby code.</p>

<ul>
<li>Did this class use the same variable with the same mistake?</li>

<li>Was this method accidentally called with the wrong object anywhere else</li>

<li>Was this a data error, logic mistake, typo, misunderstanding? (How likely is this to be a one off bug vs. a cluster)</li>

<li>Do you remember debugging something like this in a related area fairly recently, If so likely worth digging in more.</li>

<li>A quick check can find and save many related bugs from popping up, over and over.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p>Was this a Really serious bug?</p>

<ul>
<li>Audit all related code. Looking at all calling code and everything relying on results from the buggy section of code.</li>

<li>Did you just find a bug in authentication, encryption, payment services, etc? You better believe you should have one or two devs look for similar errors.</li>

<li>Where else in the code is there anything similar to this that could be impacted</li>

<li>Why didn&#8217;t a test catch this bug?</li>

<li>After the bug is fixed was it serious enough there needs to be a follow up post-mortem, meeting, log audits, discussions with the original code author(s)?</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p>Hmmm this was just a tiny bug but there is similar code all over the place. * Did you just fix the same bug 3 places in arrow? If so time to Isolate buggy issue. * If there are many related pieces of code dealing with the same issue often in slightly different ways, it is extremely likely there is a bug. * It also means that if you hack something to fix the bug, you likely only fixed one manifestation of the bug, or by fixing the known case created a new unknown bug.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Is this bug to big of problem to fix it all right now? Fix the initial known bug. Then in a <a href='http://pragmati.st/2012/03/10/the-war-on-comments/'>rare time where comments are better than code</a>. Comment on the hack pointing to related past bugs and potential other bugs. If you have even built up the mental model of a solution or two perhaps leave that information as well. We all have had to hack around some bug just to make it through the day, but if you come back a second time to fix a bug and find a comment like that, you have some refactoring in your future, dig in and get to it.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>If you wrote the code and just authored a bug fix for a issue, perhaps ask another dev to give a quick code review of the code, class, or method. Fresh eyes can do wonders to illuminate a subtle deeper issue.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Likely a obvious one, but write a test that fails then fix the bug? Exceptions on production you say! Fine fix, deploy, then locally revert the fix and get that test around the error case.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>A much harder thing to fix but good to understand. Was the bug cluster caused by a bad data model. Code that isn&#8217;t representative of the problem and task at hand? If so there might be a larger discussion or refactoring to start to consider.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h3 id='clusters_its_not_just_for_bugs'>Clusters, it&#8217;s not just for bugs</h3>
<div class='blog-header' data-title='Not just for bugs'>
</div>
<p>Code patterns are everywhere: styles, library usage, thoughts, developers, late night bad hacking, good day, bad day, new shiny obsession, dead feature, big O blindness, N+1, slow methods, service abuse?</p>

<p>Pretty much any pattern the human mind can recognize can and will cluster in code. If you are trying to fix up, undo, remove, or improve code it helps to understand a bit of context. Just a little extra context can explain why the code exists the way it does. Git blame your lines, methods, and features to learn some possible historical context. See what other code was added or modified around the same time. I find that helpfully when sleuthing for all other possible related bugs? I actually find more often that this sort of &#8216;code cluster&#8217; is more useful when removing a feature or doing performance work. It is good to know that code pattern form clusters like this in general but, I have found that following up on the patterns particularly for performance issues can have huge payoffs. If you find a simple but large performance win, dig into the code cluster finding all related code.</p>

<p>I was working on performance problems for a specific Rails action. I found that it was doing the most naive and simple thing possible, which is great and in the past never really cause an issue. As the data size changed it was blatantly obvious that it was making hundreds of unnecessary calls per request and reducing the result set down for display to the first 5. Basically <code>get_massive_result_collection[0?5]</code>, Ok simple fix, added ability to pass a limit <code>get_massive_result_collection(:limit =&gt; 5)</code>. I realized that when the collection method was first added to the code, it&#8217;s usage had been spread all through out the app. I got the important performance fix deployed to production and saw a order of magnitude difference proving this was a pretty valuable discovery. I immediately created a ticket to follow up on all calls to the existing collection method in the app and find how many were abusing it. Over the next week or two I was able to knock incredible amounts of time of nearly every page load as the method was being used in application layouts, common partials, and spread since it was originally implemented. The code changes where each simple after tracking down the initial performance mistake. I personally will always spend a bit of time spelunking the code now to follow up on related code after discovering a large performance win.</p>

<p>Seriously we are are pattern recognition machines, get good at it and use it! Keep a eye out for the patterns in your code. Understand that it can help you with bug fixing, refactoring, performance, dead code removal, and more. No piece of code is written in complete isolation, if it was it really wouldn&#8217;t be able to do much. So consider the code clusters the surround your changes, and can help you prevent a bug that has gone undetected.</p><mbp:pagebreak /><br/><hr/><a name='chap5' /><h3><a href='http://mayerdan.com/ruby/2013/03/03/repetitive-hash-syntax-my-quest-for-a-self-referring-hash'>Repetitive Hash Syntax, My quest for a Self Referring Hash</a></h3><div>updated: 03/03/2013 at 12:00AM</div><br/><p>For years a tiny code style issue has bothered me in Ruby. I find myself frequently building up a set of variables and then building a Hash where the keys all match the variables. It is a small nit-pick, and never wastes much time, but it has always annoyed me. The wasted duplication to have <code>{:some_key =&gt; some_key}</code> for a long list of variables, when the key and the variable are named the same. Convention over configuration and all that. Ruby is a beautiful and flexible language. Why can&#8217;t we make it simpler and cleaner to create a Hash based of some locally defined variables. It turns out more complicated than one would think, because of trying to bind to the current variable scope.</p>

<p>In the end what I wanted was a way to create a hash that would looks something like this, which I like to call a SelfReferringHash</p>

<p>I mentioned this annoyance years ago to <a href='https://github.com/ahoward'>Ara Howard</a>, and he whipped up a <a href='http://drawohara.com/post/151193800/ruby-symbol-to-hash'>example very quickly</a>, but it didn&#8217;t feel quite right. Ara proposed a <a href='https://gist.github.com/ahoward/157787'>few iterations</a> with various syntax&#8217;s <code>:result.to_h{}</code> or <code>[:a, :b, :c].to_h{}</code> but the syntax was distracting. So I kind of forgot about the issue and forgot about the issue for awhile.</p>

<p>I then recently came across this post <a href='http://alex.nisnevich.com/blog/2012/07/30/fun_with_ruby_hashes.html'>Playing Around with Ruby Hashes</a>. Where Alex wants to add various features such as setting a arbitrarily deep value on the Hash without all the intermediate checks and creation of empty hashes</p>

<p>In the end, this might be interesting if I had some other things to patch onto the Hash object. Unfortunately it seems like this still isn&#8217;t really that useful and it is a bit to awkward. I could never avoid the primary issue I had with Ara&#8217;s examples of having to awkwardly pass the context. All solutions seem to require you to pass a empty block to be able to bind to the context and access the variables at that time. Having a initializer or a class method which requires <code>{}</code> just seems to awkward to be useable. So after all this time I am still left feeling, unsatisfied. While this is a very simple problem to understand and Ruby is a very flexible language. The issues of binding to a context and variable scoping makes building a more beautiful and usable version of a self referring Hash out of my reach.</p>

<p>If anyone has suggestions or ideas on how to build something that is a bit cleaner or closer to my goal and doesn&#8217;t resort to passing a empty block, I would love to see any other solutions. Perhaps, I am missing some more interesting way to bend Ruby to fit my mind.</p><mbp:pagebreak /><br/><hr/><a name='chap6' /><h3><a href='http://mayerdan.com/ruby/2013/02/17/s3-files-mime-types'>Setting mime-type / content-type when uploading files to S3</a></h3><div>updated: 02/17/2013 at 12:00AM</div><br/><p>I was having a issue where after uploading a file to S3, it wouldn&#8217;t allow any user to view the file with a browser, but only download the file.

<p>I am using the <a href='http://fog.io/'>Fog.io</a> library to upload files and manage EC2 servers. It turns out that the ruby std lib File object doesn&#8217;t have any methods to help with mime type.

This code base is a older code base that spans to many responsibilities. It&#8217;s stability and performance is important, because of this central roll. It is a point that many other teams need to interact with. Any downtime or large exceptions can have a significant impact on the company or many other teams relying on this project as a API.</p>

<p>As the number of developers and teams within our company has grown so has how we manage code going into this central project. We began requiring the majority of code going into the project to have <a href='http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2006/01/code-reviews-just-do-it.html'>code reviews</a>. We also went from only having developers who had a lot of experience with the central project to many developers who only touch it a hand full of times and work on other projects for their day to day development. This generally meant when a developer from another project needed a small change they needed some help finding their way around the project and to understand the context where they would be making changes.</p>

<p>The changes and growth lead the team I am on to being overwhelmed with requests to review code, answer questions, and help other teams integrate changes into the project. At first we tried to just deal with this ad hoc as situations arose. While this sort of worked for awhile, it lead to a number of distractions and interruptions for all the developers on our team. It also made it hard to plan and schedule our own features as we didn&#8217;t know when or which one of our developers might get pulled of task to help another team work with the codebase. We needed a better way to work with other developers and teams, and a way to help review the constant flow of new code being pushed into the project. Code needed to be reviewed often coming in from all the other devs on our team freed up to focus on getting things done.</p>

<p>For me personally the constant flow of interruptions was endangering my ability to have and longer period of focus, or get any significant work done because of <a href='http://37signals.com/svn/posts/2272-the-interruption-tax'>the interruption tax</a>.</p>

<h2 id='introducing_a_first_responder'>Introducing a first responder</h2>

<p>We decided to schedule one person from our team a week to do nothing but help other developers get code into our project. The first responder (on-call, bug catcher, or on-duty) developer does the majority of the code review during their week. They take emails coming in for live bugs and if it is something tiny they fix it immediately or determine if another developer on the team needs to immediately focus on that issue. They help PM get estimates on upcoming work to at least ballpark if it is worth discussing. They look over other teams proposed features, branches, and Pull Requests to varying degrees. Sometimes all that is needed is a code review of the final changes, other times having a quick meeting with a team to discuss the requirements of their feature and what changes in the central project would need to occur to support their feature. Occasionally the first-responder will end up pair programming with another developer to help share knowledge of the codebase and help them integrate their changes.</p>

<p>We rotate who is the first responder on the team each week. It can actually be pretty hectic and a bit scary. Some days you will get slammed with so many incoming requests bouncing quickly from one idea to another, and all the context switching will wear you out. Other days, you get to learn a lot about a part of the code base that you might not have been as familiar with previously, or with another team&#8217;s work which is new to you. It is definitely a challenging week that requires a different set of skills than our normal development duties.</p>

<p>This has freed up the rest of our team&#8217;s developers to better focus on the features and work that we had planned. It makes it less likely a unexpected hiccup will knock all our devs off schedule. It has also reduced the tiny little interruptions that destroy developers ability to focus and do real development.</p>

<h4 id='share_the_expectations_to_other_teams'>Share the expectations to other teams</h4>

<p>When our team introduced the first responder, we emailed all developers at the company. We shared our plan for a first responder and a email address to get in touch with our team&#8217;s first responder. The email went to the first responder who is on duty that week, but also allows the rest of our team to have a high level of what is going on by lurking on email threads. We let teams know that if there is a more immediate need they can jump in our campfire room and ask questions where anyone from the team can help respond, and we always update the room info to let people know who is the first responder this week. We asked that people try email and campfire channels prior to falling back to IMing a developer directly. We also added all the information to our projects README, so that new developers joining a team can find out quickly how to best interact with the central project.</p>

<p>We aren&#8217;t the only team at our company that has been creating the first responder position, in fact we weren&#8217;t even the first. Other teams naturally evolved similar positions. Since we have been using the first responder on our team for awhile now. I think I can safely say it has been a big improvement. I have been happy to see more teams adopting similar rotation roles as well, as it has been great to have someone as a point of contact when trying to work with a project when you less familiar with it.</p>

<p>While the satisfaction of being the first responder is different than normal tasks, helping someone ship a big new feature for their team can be very rewarding. So can mentoring more junior developers to help them solve a problem in a better way. There is also a certain joy of helping review and ship 10 - 15 smaller deployments to production, getting a bit in the code review zone of a review deployment / cycle. I know that I believe it has helped increase the overall quality of the code getting to the production system. It has also helped us to streamline and more quickly process a rapid flow of pull requests without slowing down the development pace as much (So has standardizing and sharing a set of expectations for pull requests for our project, but more on that in another post). I don&#8217;t like adding to much process to the development flow, but I think the right amount of process helps keep healthy balance between <a href='http://www.randsinrepose.com/archives/2012/11/14/stables_and_volatiles.html'>Stables and Volatiles</a>, ensuring they can work together while trying to get some of the benefits of each group. If your team seems to be frequently knocked off task by outside requests or facing a growing backlog of necessary code reviews, I highly recommend implementing the team first responder.</p>

<h6 id='unsolved_first_responder_issue'>Unsolved First Responder Issue</h6>

<p>* A developer on my team pointed out one problem we have been having with the first responder rotation. We work on a distributed team, so we have rotations that involve developers in different timezones. If the first responder is on the west coast and a early morning issue occurs someone needs to respond. Currently a east coaster will drop what they are doing to step in to the first responder role to help with whatever live bug fighting is going on. We don&#8217;t really have a good solution for this issue yet.</p><mbp:pagebreak /><br/><hr/><a name='chap9' /><h3><a href='http://mayerdan.com/ruby/2012/11/11/bugs-per-line-of-code-ratio'>ratio of bugs per line of code</a></h3><div>updated: 11/11/2012 at 12:00AM</div><br/><p><strong>The more development I do the more I feel like increased Lines Of Code (LOC), nearly always results in increased bugs.</strong> <div class='blog-header' data-title='ratio of bugs per line of code'>
</div> I know that seems obvious at first, but hear me out, as many refactorings, abstractions, &#8216;cleaner&#8217; code increases the LOC.</p>

<p>I have been reviewing a lot of code lately and the larger the added LOC are the more concerned I am about being able to fully understand and review the code. Even when I fully understand the purpose of the new code, I know lurking in each line could be a subtle but important bug. Seems obvious at first, but shouldn&#8217;t the overall complexity of the change and level of difficulty of the code be a large part of the equation as well? Most of the time the answer is not really. Reviewing new code going into a project each line introduces a new place for a bug to exist, even when each individual line is incredibly simple. So reviewing a &#8216;simple&#8217; code change of 600 LOC is still often times far more risky than a complex change of 100 LOC (^1).</p>

<p>My team has been working on refactoring and cleaning up a large older code base. One of the biggest issues now is just the sheer volume of unused, near duplicated, or overly abstracted code. The cognitive load associated with understanding all the implications of a change, and who might be relying on a specific quirk in a piece of existing code.</p>

<p>This made me think about many of the great developers I know and how they try to avoid creating large code bases. Which is why I think eventually many great developers start to really favor the most succinct code to accomplish their task. Often it is slightly less readable (chaining injects, transformations, and reductions to a collection in one line), but it leaves such a small surface area for bugs to linger. Which is why I think so many incredibly smart engineers who enjoy the beauty of code move from writing verbose &#8216;readable&#8217; explicit code with big objects and reusable modules, to condense and succinct but powerful code. Often favoring simpler objects, relationships, and data structures.</p>

<p>I think the best example of developer trajectory of verbosity to conciseness comes from Steve Yegge, who gives a outrageous example of beginner code compared to expert code, to illustrate his point in <a href='http://steve-yegge.blogspot.ca/2008/02/portrait-of-n00b.html'>Portrait of a N00b</a>. While he admits that example is a bit of a joke, he does seem to have some support for my premise.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I happen to hold a hard-won minority opinion about code bases. In particular I believe, quite staunchly I might add, that the worst thing that can happen to a code base is size.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&#8211; Yegge in <a href='http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2007/12/codes-worst-enemy.html'>codes worst enemy</a></p>

<p>In fact many developers talk about how <a href='http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2006/07/diseconomies-of-scale-and-lines-of-code.html'>LOC is the enemy of software projects</a>. The linked post references 37 Signals (several times), Seth Godin, and heavily quotes Steve McConnell all supporting how much more difficult and less time efficient it is to manage large code bases.</p>

<p>I think in part the reason large codebases are such a problem is that as the code grows, so does the number of existing bugs in the system. The ratio of bugs per lines of code is pretty constant for a project based on the methods the team has followed while adding features and code to the project. Many of the articles I am linking to, point out the the cost of adding code doesn&#8217;t grow linerly but get&#8217;s orders of magnitude worse as the code base grows.</p>

<h3 id='bug_to_code_ratios'>Bug to code ratios</h3>
<div class='blog-header' data-title='Bug to code ratios'>
</div>
<p>The idea of bugs per lines of code isn&#8217;t really a new idea. Steve McConnell, the primary source for the previously mentioned post, has written extensively on defects per lines of code. Covering average bugs per LOC stats in his great book <a href='http://www.amazon.com/Code-Complete-Practical-Handbook-Construction/dp/0735619670'>Code Complete</a></p>

<pre><code>(a) Industry Average: &quot;about 15 - 50 errors per 1000 lines of delivered
code.&quot; He further says this is usually representative of code that has some
level of structured programming behind it, but probably includes a mix of
coding techniques.

(b) Microsoft Applications: &quot;about 10 - 20 defects per 1000 lines of code
during in-house testing, and 0.5 defect per KLOC (KLOC IS CALLED AS 1000 lines of code) in released
product (Moore 1992).&quot; He attributes this to a combination of code-reading
techniques and independent testing (discussed further in another chapter of
his book).

(c) &quot;Harlan Mills pioneered &#39;cleanroom development&#39;, a technique that has
been able to achieve rates as low as 3 defects per 1000 lines of code during
in-house testing and 0.1 defect per 1000 lines of code in released product
(Cobb and Mills 1990). A few projects - for example, the space-shuttle
software - have achieved a level of 0 defects in 500,000 lines of code using
a system of format development methods, peer reviews, and statistical
testing.&quot;</code></pre>

<p>Going further McConnell talks about the value of <a href='http://www.stevemcconnell.com/ieeesoftware/bp09.htm'>defect tracking</a>. As well as the speed of writing <a href='http://www.stevemcconnell.com/articles/art04.htm'>quality software in relationship to the defect rate</a>, and bugs related to a team&#8217;s <a href='http://www.stevemcconnell.com/articles/art02.htm'>software development process maturity</a>.</p>

<p>I think McConnell places too high of cost on bugs, at least for modern agile web development. He is mostly discussing the issues in the context of shipped (Microsoft, NASA, and defense), opposed continuously deployed web apps where most bugs can be solved quickly and the mean time to recovery matters more than have a extremely low bug rate. (yes +1 for Facebook&#8217;s <a href='http://spectrum.ieee.org/at-work/innovation/facebook-philosophy-move-fast-and-break-things'>Move Fast and Break Things</a>). I do agree with McConnell that more bugs in the software will also slow the speed of development, as it increases the cognitive load.</p>

<p>Working on a large project with many developers of varying skill, I often push for easily readable code. I think it is important that anyone on the team can work on the code. When more easily readable code starts to increase total code size, these two ideas are at odds. That dichotomy is what brought all of this to the front of my mind. I have been increasingly been hesitant to believe a refactoring just for the sake of slight readability at the cost of increased lines of code is a good thing.</p>

<p>I do think heavily functional and succinct code is far better for back end systems and complex functions and less likely to cause maintainability problems. So while I might slowly be writing more chained and dense code, I don&#8217;t think it works everywhere. I have yet to see how that kind of succinct &#8216;clean&#8217; code can handle user input exceptions, and highly conditional view layers. I think part of it might be why experienced developers like to work on frameworks and more isolated services where one can produce and enforce such &#8216;pretty&#8217; code.</p>

<h2 id='final_thoughts'>Final Thoughts</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>Keep your code tiny. Fight extra complexity and lines of code and strike down upon it with great vengeance &amp; furious anger&#8230;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&#8211;<a href='http://quotes.dictionary.com/And_I_will_strike_down_upon_thee_with'>not quite what was said in Pulp Fiction</a></p>

<p>I think bugs to LOC ratio is one of the main reasons having a large codebase is bad. I believe the cognitive load of having to write code that functions around all the bugs/quirks in a code base is why progress slows so much on larger code bases. I think large codebases being bad is one of the reasons why SOA, <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rKEveL55TY'>Micro-Service Architecture</a>, Heroku&#8217;s <a href='http://rubyconf2008.confreaks.com/lightweight-web-services.html'>Lightweight Web Services</a>, and Github&#8217;s <a href='http://zachholman.com/posts/scaling-github-employees/'>building mini-apps</a> is the solution all larger apps end up moving towards.</p>

<p>While I still place a incredibly high value on the readability of code, and often find a Collection#each accumulating into another variable more readable than Collection#inject. I think developers should error on the side of less code, unless there are clear improvements to having more code. Especially when trying to refactor to improve the readability of the code.</p>

<p>Based on this I feel like refactorings that are introducing more lines of code for the sake of readability are often just moving the complexity around. It often feels like a win, but it has a good probability to introduce more bugs. In some cases is actually only more clear to the refactoring author.</p>

<p>Related to refactoring making code larger, while small testable methods are great. If each method just is another layer of abstraction deferring to yet another method before the meat of the problem is solved, it is less likely to be a improvement. Abstractions have a cognitive load and each leaky abstraction layer is another potential buggy line of code. Design patterns can be great but knowing when they are overkill takes time.</p>

<p>I am not saying all refactoring is bad, in fact I think bug LOC ratios increase the importance of some refactorings. A refactoring that doesn&#8217;t make the code easier to read (and likely not any more difficult) but delivers the same functionality while reducing the total LOC is a big win. A win in terms of maintainability, it reduces the far too frequent bugs where multiple files/functions need to be &#8216;kept in sync&#8217; to ensure correct functionality.</p>

<p>One failing in my keep the project as small as possible idea, is user input and UX. All those dedicated to succinct code, please show me great examples of user input error handling and complex conditional view layers. I still haven&#8217;t seen good ways to approach these issues short of writing more code and trying to make all of the conditions as clear and small as possible. (Often products made for developers solve this by only allowing for tiny number of possible conditions. I don&#8217;t think that approach works in reality when working with designers and UX teams, who often have clear use cases for each conditional)</p>

<p>Since I was passing some API keys over to my Sinatra server, I wanted to make sure I could hit the API via https.

For me basically just the few steps enabled https</p>

<pre><code>emacs /opt/bitnami/apache2/conf/httpd.conf
#uncomment LoadModule ssl_module modules/mod_ssl.so
#uncomment Include conf/extra/httpd-ssl.conf
emacs /opt/bitnami/apache2/conf/extra/httpd-ssl.conf

<p>That got me part of the way there, but the instructions on creating a self-signed cert could have been a bit better and more clear, here is what I ran to generate my cert.</p>

<pre><code>$ cd /opt/bitnami/apache2/conf
$ openssl genrsa -des3 -out privkey.pem 1024 
$ openssl req -new -key privkey.pem -out cert.csr

$ apachectl restart    </code></pre>

<p>That should do it, you should now be able to reach the same Ruby app behind https that was initially running on http.

I also wanted it to be useable when you are offline, since phones loose connection often in metros, planes, lines, etc. One goal with the project is to keep it is small enough that I can build it and play around with different ideas. It is such a small app, that I could rewrite the entire thing with a new methodology if I wanted. Which is exactly what I plan on starting to do. I wanted a app that I could practice new skills and techniques on, while still being useful, and something I would use on a day to day basis. I started working on the project with the idea to build up a chain of doing some open source experimental development having a playground to try things and learn. A small app where I could push myself to look at new technologies, and to force myself to release them into a production environment, opposed to another one off script or tests that never see the light of day. I highly recommend forcing yourself to do a bit of development every day, it is recommended by a bunch of smart people (<a href='http://pragprog.com/the-pragmatic-programmer'>Andrew Hunt and David Thomas&#8217;s The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master</a>, <a href='http://www.amazon.com/Passionate-Programmer-Remarkable-Development-Pragmatic/dp/1934356344'>Chad Folwer&#8217;s The Passionate Programmer</a>, <a href='http://www.amazon.com/Hackers-Painters-Big-Ideas-Computer/dp/0596006624'>Paul Graham&#8217;s Hackers and Painters</a>). I was in part inspired by <a href='http://twitter.com/#!/eee_c'>Chris Strom (@eee_c)</a>, who has done incredible work keeping up a chain and blogging about what he learns. NothingCalendar is a testament to what you can do in about 15 minutes a day. That is about how much time I have spent on it most evenings. Just forcing myself to do a bit every day, has led to my longest <a href='http://calendaraboutnothing.com/~danmayer'>streak on CalendarAboutNothing</a> (66 days at the moment). Just remembering to code a bit everyday, keeps the project in your mind, keeps you improving it. It also makes refactoring little things a perfect task, you only have a few minutes take something on. Complete a tiny refactoring of from a todo list and check it in. I frequently just check in #TODO comments, and grep for them when I don&#8217;t have much time or an idea of what to work on. After a tiny todo, call it a day and know you will have more time sometime soon to do something more substantial. Please give NothingCalendar a try, and let me know how it goes or any problems / feature ideas. I will will be working more more on it each day, and trying to rewrite large parts of the app using some new ideas.</p><mbp:pagebreak /><br/><hr/><a name='chap17' /><h3><a href='http://mayerdan.com/2011/11/13/working-with-Facebook--Dialog-Feed-and-urls-with-params'>working with Facebook  Dialog Feed and urls with params</a></h3><div>updated: 11/13/2011 at 12:00AM</div><br/><p>Facebook&#8217;s documentation always sucks.

Yes, that is a problem and we should start to do something about it. For now that problem exists but it leads to wanting to do some weird things. I wanted to work on code in a branch, while my tests were running in another. I had cloned the project twice so I had two versions, of the project, the issue was the branch I wanted to work in hadn&#8217;t been pushed remote. I then realized since it is git I could easily solve the problem by pointing my second version of my project at the first and fetching all of my local branches! Git is pretty great that you can solve things like this. It also means you could easily just run git off a shared network filesystem, no reason to really setup a fancy git server. Here are the steps make a second version of a project and then fetch the local branches from your first version # if you haven&#8217;t clone a second version of the project do that from the filesystem or the git server&gt; cd project_2&gt; git clone /Users/danmayer/projects/project_1&gt; Cloning into project_1&#8230; # in the second version of your project add a remote repo pointing at the original version of the project on your filesystem&gt; cd project_1&gt; git remote add local /Users/danmayer/projects/project_1/&gt; git fetch local&gt; git branch #=&gt; a list of the branches on your first projects directory This is a pretty simple thing to do, but when I ran into the issue it took me a bit of time to realize how simple it was to solve this problem. It also just illustrates just how versatile git really is.</p><mbp:pagebreak /><br/><hr/><a name='chap21' /><h3><a href='http://mayerdan.com/2011/10/23/Simplifying-new-gemset-creation-for-RVM'>Simplifying new gemset creation for RVM</a></h3><div>updated: 10/23/2011 at 12:00AM</div><br/><p>Ruby, environment, developmentI found myself annoyed that each time I created a new project I had to go through the same steps to create and setup my gemset. I am also trying to be better about automating things I do over and over. I decided I should put something in my .bash_profile to simplify my frequent task of making a new gemset on a brand new project. The manual way I ended up creating gemsets in the past, was:* cd to project_directory* rvm use ree (my preferred local ruby run time)* rvm gemset create projectGemSet* echo &#8216;rvm use ree@projectGemSet&#8217; &gt; .rvmrc* cd ../* cd project_directiory* agree to trust the .rvmrc file That is pretty simple, but gets a bit annoying to do over and over. I figured I could very quickly whip up a solution in my bash profile. Unfortunately, due to my shell scripting skills kind of sucking, I ended up using Ruby. Basically after adding my new ruby script to my .bash_profile, I can now just type &#8216;init_gemset newgemset&#8217;, and I will be left in my project using my new gemset. The final script is below. <script src='https://gist.github.com/1257690.js?file=init_gemset.rb'> </script> One thing to note is the time saved with automating a repetitive task vs. time spent to automate it. In the end because of spending a decent amount of time trying to write this as a shell script without using Ruby. I likely spent more time getting this script working, than it will ever save me. It also isn&#8217;t even fully reusable for other people in it&#8217;s current state (the .bash_profile function needs a full path to the ruby script in it, and my preferred RVM ruby is hard coded). It could be made more easily reusable / sharable (likely making it a gem, or sending a pull request to RVM itself with this as a feature). Doing this the fully &#8216;right&#8217; way would just add more time spent, on something I initially did to save a few moments. I wanted to get back to what I was originally working on, and I had something that would work for me. So I will leave it here as a simple gist. Working on this also made me think about what is worth spending time automating. In terms of savings this likely wasn&#8217;t worth much, but there are many times that a repetitive task is really begging for automation.</p><mbp:pagebreak /><br/><hr/><a name='chap22' /><h3><a href='http://mayerdan.com/2011/10/02/ActiveRecord-Association-objects-can-act-weird-bug-in-associationany'>ActiveRecord Association objects can act weird (bug in association#any?)</a></h3><div>updated: 10/02/2011 at 12:00AM</div><br/><p>Rails, RubyI found a weird issue when working with <a href='http://apidock.com/rails/ActiveRecord/Associations/AssociationProxy'>ActiveRecord AssociationProxy objects</a>, they weren&#8217;t proxying the method correctly. The issue arose when trying to use the #any? method on an array which should be true when empty. When calling this on a AssociationProxy object that has 0 items it was returning false. Oddly enough inspecting or to_s the association and then calling #any? resulted in the correct behavior. It was so weird though that after looking at other options I ended up using the present?, which always behaved how I expected it to. Even weirder is the issue only presented itself in the rails server debug and production modes. It always acted as one would expect in rails console. I started to dig in more, but ended up yak shaving a lot of other stuff to try to learn exactly what the cause was. If anyone understands the issue better, I would be happy to know more. Until then, be aware that at least in the 2.3.X versions of rails, ActiveRecord AssociationProxy#any? acts funky and should not be trusted. Use a work around like present? or length &gt; 0 (both worked correctly in console and on dev/production server environments). This is one of these issues where there is so much going on in the rails stack that it is hard to determine where the issue lies. So for those googling this issue, beware AssociationProxy.any? on has_many relationships.

I am in that mode pretty much all the time. One thing that annoyed me was opening a file on the side of the screen I wanted.

Anyways I often opened a file on the wrong side of the screen and wanted to move the buffer. Previously I always closed the buffer, then switched to the other emacs window (C-x o) then reopened the file. This annoyed me to know end, so I finally went looking for a solution. I found something that was close, but not what I wanted, which <a href='http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1774832/how-to-swap-the-buffers-in-2-windows-emacs'>swaps two buffers positions left and right</a>, so I started with that code and modified it to do just what I want.

Most people hate and don&#8217;t use tabs in emacs so that one tab closing could be commented out. I love tabs because I am a very spacial person and the tabs let me keep the physical location of the buffers in my head. This was written to run in Aquamacs, but will work equally well in standard emacs. Just drop it in your .emacs file or emacs config directory.

Their Aren&#8217;t great example of how to do this out there, so I figured a quick blog post was in order. I search around for how to do this when getting started with PhoneGap, and the best example I could find was, <a href='http://www.somms.net/2010/05/28/native-messages-for-android-phonegap/'>Native messages for Android PhoneGap</a>. Following this example, I was able to get my own Javascript interface working. Basically you create a class (using java for android example): <script src='http://gist.github.com/470919.js?file=CustomJS.java'> </script>I create this private class in the main Java class which extends DroidGap (the class that boots up PhoneGap and creates the webview UI). <script src='http://gist.github.com/470920.js?file=extendDroidGap.java'> </script> Then in your html you can call in javascript bridged Java functions like <code>var myData = CUSTOM.getData();</code> which will return the java data (in this case a string) to the javascript. I have used the JS bride to begin new Android Activities, Close the WebView and move entirely to Native code. Background the WebUI to do something native for awhile, then return the WebView back to the front, Etc. <script src='http://gist.github.com/470922.js?file=customJSPhoneGap.js'> </script> This can be done similarly for the iPhone and Objective-C to Javascript with PhoneGap. This lets you leverage extra native flexibility while still building the majority of your app as JS, CSS, and HTML.</p><mbp:pagebreak /><br/><hr/><a name='chap27' /><h3><a href='http://mayerdan.com/2010/07/06/Mobile-Development-and-My-Recommendation-for-PhoneGap'>Mobile Development and My Recommendation for PhoneGap</a></h3><div>updated: 07/06/2010 at 12:00AM</div><br/><p>In the last month or so I have been exploring mobile development. I wrote basic native Android and iPhone apps. I also build cross platform apps using Rhodes, Titanium, and PhoneGap. I thought it would be good to share my thoughts and experiences on the mobile dev space. If you want full control and are doing a lot of local heavy processing (CPU bound) native is the way to go. I program to the web data without access I don&#8217;t do much interesting. When the whole app basically relies on live data I feel javascript, HTML, and CSS is the way to go. Not only am I already familiar with it, but basically the app can share code with the mobile site. Also, using JS, HTML, and CSS gives the most flexibility in terms of supporting multiple devices. Since I wasn&#8217;t using anything specific to a single mobile device or really pushing the hardware, I quickly moved away from fully native apps. It wasn&#8217;t worth the time and extra effort to write nearly the same app in Java, Objective C, and whatever else. Game developers, and those doing a bunch with video, photos, etc are probably most interested in native apps and probably won&#8217;t be as interested in other options. This lead me to explore <a href='http://rhomobile.com/products/rhodes/'>Rhodes</a>, <a href='http://www.appcelerator.com/'>Titanium</a>, and <a href='http://phonegap.com'>PhoneGap</a> as alternatives to purely native apps. All of which let you leverage HTML and CSS for building a UI. Rhodes lets you write code in Ruby using a MVC framework. You leverage html (erb/haml) views using a Ruby back end to make remote requests, interact with a DB, and interact with native phone components. It is a cool framework, and obviously since it is Ruby, I enjoyed writing the code. However, it obscured the actual process of making an app for a device a bit much for my comfort. If something went wrong anywhere in the stack or if you wanted to break out of the Rhodes way to do something native on a platform it was difficult to do. It tries to manage the entire app development end to end hiding any per device customizations away from you. Since I wanted to be able to use some existing libraries for Android and iPhones, this limitation was a dealbreaker. Titanium and PhoneGap use the same basic approach as each other providing a javascript library, which interfaces with native code for each device. You write an app in JS/HTML/CSS and make calls to the JS library to interact with native elements like the accelerometer, GPS, buttons, etc. I think it&#8217;s a big win to be able to write most of the app in familiar web languages basically utilizing Ajax and local storage to give a nice mobile experience. Getting up and running on either Titanium or PhoneGap was painless. Again, in the end I wanted more control over some native components which caused me to choose PhoneGap over Titanium. While the concept is the same for both of these products, their approach is very different. Titanium is a bit more all or nothing of an approach, you develop in Titanium&#8217;s little world and it is best to not go out ofit. PhoneGap takes a extremely lightweight and minimalist approach to getting your project running on each device. It gives you basically the bare necessities and gets out of your way. PhoneGap doesn&#8217;t try to configure the build environment and it doesn&#8217;t manage simulators. To create a app with PhoneGap for any mobile platform you point to the same web directory (HTML, CSS, JS, and images), then generate a native app for the device. At that point you have the same native app project you would have if you were to start from scratch but you have a few nice libraries and code started for you. If you don&#8217;t like the way PhoneGap does something, that is fine delete it, override it, extend it. You need to do something native PhoneGap doesn&#8217;t support add your own JS handlers and interact with new or existing native code. I needed to allow for FaceBook connect login on Android, which PhoneGap doesn&#8217;t support no problem. FaceBook maintains a Android SDK, which I imported into my PhoneGap project and added JS handlers which call to the FaceBook Android native code. There is a bug in Androids SSL cert verification for WebKit that was causing errors for HTTPS access, drop into java override the SSL Cert verification and fixed that. This would be difficult to do with Rhodes or Titanium because they don&#8217;t allow you easily write and interact with your own native code. The project has to work only through the API provided to you to stay cross compatible. Which is great in some ways, but very limiting if you want to break out and just tweak a few little things. I have been extremely happy working with PhoneGap, it rocks. It lets you build a native mobile app as a locally cached and privileged mobile website. You can leverage existing mobile site code for the native app. It will still be better than a pure website experience. It lets you piggyback on skill web developers already have. It is a great way to make use of HTML5 local DBs, local data, and HTML templates. It encourages you follow best practices for building a mobile site that works offline and requests only minimal JSON so it can fast over slow internet. Before building an app with PhoneGap I recommend building a mobile site. Learn about best practices for the mobile web. If you are new to developing sites for mobile, I highly recommend following the recommendations from <a href='http://www.engineyard.com/video/12678746'>Yehuda Katz on building great mobile sites</a>. He discusses some things specific to Rails 3, but mostly just good JS practices. In many ways when building a PhoneGap app you are just building a mobile website. You have access to utilizing some native things that you can&#8217;t with pure HTML/CSS. Local storage is a good example, it is supported by HTML5, but the earlier Android webkit didn&#8217;t support it. Using PhoneGap you have local storage on old devices and it can use standard HTML5 local storage on newer devices. Last but not least, PhoneGap has a great <a href='http://www.phonegap.com/community'>active community</a>. Drop into #phonegap on freenode and people are always around to help out. The mailing list has a constant flow of questions and answers. While <a href='http://www.phonegap.com/docs'>PhoneGap docs</a> are a little out of date, there are people actively working on improving them. There are many example applications and open code on github to check out how to use PhoneGap. Also, the code is small and simple enough it is a great project to get involved in and give back. After working with it awhile, you will start to understand the internals and could help contribute patches, features, and plugins to the community.</p><mbp:pagebreak /><br/><hr/><a name='chap28' /><h3><a href='http://mayerdan.com/2010/07/03/The-Ruby-fitbit-API-has-been-updated'>The Ruby-fitbit API has been updated</a></h3><div>updated: 07/03/2010 at 12:00AM</div><br/><p>More about it can be found on here, <a href='http://github.com/danmayer/ruby-fitbit'>Ruby-fitbit api on github</a>.

I had seen some similar posts, and figured I could save someone some time. Basically when using document.addEventListener order matters a lot. It all comes down to exactly when this line is loaded and what is already defined. <pre>document.addEventListener("deviceready", deviceSetup, true);</pre> We have custom JS, and originally it was loaded second, so the deviceready event was fired before, the listener was set. <pre>        <script charset='utf-8' src='lscustom.js' type='text/javascript'> </script>         <script charset='utf-8' src='phonegap.js' type='text/javascript'> </script> </pre> After that I was still having an issue and it turns out the method you define register as the callback needs to be defined before you add the listener. So having this in our lscustom.js works. <pre>var deviceSetup = function(){   console.log("Device Setup"); };     document.addEventListener("deviceready", deviceSetup, true); While, the below fails. document.addEventListener("deviceready", deviceSetup, true); var deviceSetup = function(){   console.log("Device Setup"); }; </pre> Anyways since I ended up wasting a bit of time searching and debugging this issue, I figured I would share my debugging session.</p><mbp:pagebreak /><br/><hr/><a name='chap31' /><h3><a href='http://mayerdan.com/2010/06/21/Code-Highlighting-on-MovableType'>Code Highlighting on MovableType</a></h3><div>updated: 06/21/2010 at 12:00AM</div><br/><p><code>def code_highlighting  puts &quot;this is a highlight&quot;end</code> I found a <a href='http://blogspot.makotokw.com/portfolio/movabletype/syntaxhighlighter/'>syntaxhighlighter plugin</a>, which makes it simple to use <a href='http://alexgorbatchev.com/wiki/SyntaxHighlighter'>SyntaxHighlighter</a> on Movable Type.

I also really enjoyed how it gave me new ideas of cool things to do in my city. Especially since I just moved to DC and didn&#8217;t really know what to do. We have bought deals to restaurants we wanted to try, restaurants we already knew and loved, kennedy center brunch with a group of friends, a wine tour with a group of 5 of us going. We have really enjoyed the savings, but even more so that it helps get us out there doing and trying new things. Anyways I will be joining the development team, obviously doing Ruby stuff, since that is what I am focused on now. The team is already impressive and has accomplished a lot and scaled the site to request levels I have yet to deal with. I am excited to get to work and learn with the team, while bringing some of my skills from past experiences to help with the team.

I just converted about 1,000 posts and 3,000 comments from MovableType to Tumblr and Disqus. I decided I would host my personal blog on Tumblr, which has been interesting so far. Sucking the old posts and comments out of MovableType and pushing them to Tumblr wasn&#8217;t as easy as I had hoped. Although it gave me a chance to enjoy on of my favorite parts of being a developer. If something doesn&#8217;t exist and I want it, I can built it. So I set off to write a script that would take a Movable Type blog export and import all of the posts into Tumblr and push all of the comments to Disqus. While it wasn&#8217;t the easiest thing to do, it wasn&#8217;t that difficult either. I have slowly built up a collection of various utilities to help port from Movable Type to Wordpress, or from wordpress.org to wordpress.com. Things that help clean up formatting or remove javascript and replace it with something allowed on wordpress.org. I added my conversion script to the inconveniently named <a href='http://github.com/danmayer/MT_WP_Converter'>MT_WP_Converter</a> git repo. <a href='http://github.com/danmayer/MT_WP_Converter/blob/master/mt_tumblr_converter.rb'>View MovableType to Tumblr Converter Script</a> <script src='http://gist.github.com/412468.js?file=movabletyle_tumblr.rb'> </script> Quick Gotchas:* There are lots of older or bad example code on how to use the disqus API out there, I had a problem posting comments because all of the POST endpoints must end with a &#8217;/&#8217;, which I didn&#8217;t know. This forum post helped me <a href='http://www.ruby-forum.com/topic/180723'>fix an issue posting to disqus with rest client</a>.* Remember to turn off the facebook publishing for tumblr, before doing the import or testing it. I didn&#8217;t remember this and published the same test post on facebook about 40 times.

My emacs setup was a hodge podge of various plugins, code from friends, blogs, etc&#8230; It wasn&#8217;t organized and was hard to maintain and fine tune. I decided it was time to get my emacs config under control, and under git so it was portable and easy to revert update etc. I looked at a couple options for existing Emacs configuration setups for Ruby. <a href='http://github.com/technomancy/emacs-starter-kit'>Emacs Starter Kit</a><a href='http://github.com/topfunky/emacs-starter-kit'>Topfunky&#8217;s Emacs Starter Kit</a><a href='http://github.com/walter/aquamacs-emacs-starter-kit'>Aquamacs Starter Kit</a> In the end I ended up going with <a href='http://github.com/walter/aquamacs-emacs-starter-kit'>Aquamacs Starter Kit</a>, namely because I have been a fan of Aquamacs for awhile, and already new my way around it&#8217;s system pretty well. The original Starter kit, from Technomancy, doesn&#8217;t play nicely with Aquamacs and leads to some issues. Some people have forks that are supposed to work better with Aquamacs, but it seems the kit built from the ground up for Aquamacs works best. Topfunky&#8217;s project is based on the original emacs starter kit, but has been customized to work well with <a href='http://www.apple.com/downloads/macosx/unix_open_source/carbonemacspackage.html'>Carbon Emacs</a>, which is more cross compatible than Aquamacs, so your emacs config is more likely to be portable to all unix systems as well as OS X with Carbon emacs. This looks like a really interesting option, but I decided I liked some of the nice extra sugar that Aquamacs provides. First install <a href='http://github.com/walter/aquamacs-emacs-starter-kit'>Aquamacs starter kit</a> There were a few things that I couldn&#8217;t stand from the defaults in the Aquamacs Starter Kit and removed also some modifications that I added. ### Disabling/Removing some Starter Kit features You likely installed your starter kit to a location like, &#8216;/Users/danmayer/Library/Preferences/Aquamacs Emacs/aquamacs-emacs-starter-kit&#8217;, go there to find the files for modification. Disabling the emacs Twitter client, sorry I like my twitter to be entirely separate from my dev environment. Then edit &#8216;init.el&#8217;:<code>;;(autoload &#39;twitter-get-friends-timeline &quot;twitter&quot; nil t);;(autoload &#39;twitter-status-edit &quot;twitter&quot; nil t);;(global-set-key &quot;\C-xt&quot; &#39;twitter-get-friends-timeline);;(add-hook &#39;twitter-status-edit-mode-hook &#39;longlines-mode)</code> Disable Ruby-electric, which tries to complete various matched chars and statements as you type like &#8216;, {}. (), begin/end, if/end, etc&#8230; It drives me nuts and breaks my thought process. Edit &#8216;misc-mode-tweaks.el&#8217;:<code>;;(require &#39;ruby-electric);;(add-hook &#39;ruby-mode-hook;;          (lambda nil;;            (require &#39;ruby-electric);;            (ruby-electric-mode);;            (flymake-mode-on)))</code> ### Additions to Starter Kit I saw a Emacs package to add flog score inline to ruby method scores and thought that sounded like a great addition to help keep my methods concise, so I added that, to my .emacs: <code>;; ruby-complexity flog scores for methods http://github.com/topfunky/emacs-starter-kit/tree/master/vendor/ruby-complexity/(add-to-list &#39;load-path &quot;~/.emacs.d/vendor/ruby-complexity/&quot;)    (require &#39;linum)(require &#39;ruby-complexity)(add-hook &#39;ruby-mode-hook  (function (lambda ()      (flymake-mode)      (linum-mode)      (ruby-complexity-mode))))</code> I also liked some of the options from <a href='http://github.com/defunkt/textmate.el'>defunkt&#8217;s Textmate minor mode</a>. First &#8216;cd ~/.emacs.d/vendor; git clone git://github.com/defunkt/textmate.el.git&#8217; Again added to my .emacs file: <code>;; textmate bindings for some nicer key combos for common actions(add-to-list &#39;load-path &quot;~/.emacs.d/vendor/textmate.el&quot;)(require &#39;textmate)(textmate-mode)</code> I am just starting to get going with improving my Emacs setup, so I am sure I will likely be making additional changes. The current changes above are checked into <a href='http://github.com/danmayer/aquamacs-emacs-starter-kit'>my fork</a> of the project, feel free to pull the above changes if you&#8217;d like. If you have any great Emacs tips, tricks, or plugins I should add let me know as I am sure it can just keep getting better, but I am pretty happy for now. <a href='/assets/custom_aquamacs.jpg'><img alt='' src='/assets/custom_aquamacs_sm.jpg' /></a> <div class='zemanta-pixie' style='margin-top:10px;height:15px'>[![Reblog this post [with Zemanta]](http://img.zemanta.com/reblog_e.png?x-id=e37199cb-1e97-43c9-82a8-909a8342131f)](http://reblog.zemanta.com/zemified/e37199cb-1e97-43c9-82a8-909a8342131f/ "Reblog this post [with Zemanta]")<span class='zem-script more-related pretty-attribution'><script src='http://static.zemanta.com/readside/loader.js' defer='defer' type='text/javascript'> </script></span></div></p><mbp:pagebreak /><br/><hr/><a name='chap38' /><h3><a href='http://mayerdan.com/2010/05/10/Introducing-Ruby-Resume%2C-a-project-to-create-and-host-your-resume'>Introducing Ruby Resume, a project to create and host your resume</a></h3><div>updated: 05/10/2010 at 12:00AM</div><br/><p>Ruby, Github, Open source, Programming, Heroku, Markdown, Tools, ResumeThe <a href='http://github.com/danmayer/Resume'>Ruby Resume project</a>, is a project I started to make it easier for Ruby developers to create, host, share their resume, and keep it up to date. It is an open source project, that anyone can use to help manage their resume online. It offers a variety of options and you can take or leave any part you wish. Basically, you fork the project, alter some things for your needs, and can contribute interesting additions back to the shared Ruby Resume project. The project uses Sinatra, Markdown, and a collection of Rake tasks to get the job done. What does the Ruby Resume project do?- Supports deploying your resume to <a href='http://heroku.com'>Heroku</a> in a variety of formats.</p>

<ul>
<li>Easily deploy your app to any Sinatra compatible host</li>

<li>Allows simple publishing of your resume to your github personal page.</li>

<li>It makes it simple to publish your resume as a gem. I got the idea for a <a href='http://groups.google.com/group/rails-business/msg/68cf8a890c0d4fc8?pli=1'>personal resume gem</a> from <a href='http://twitter.com/edavis10'>Eric Davis</a>.</li>

<li>It uses Markdown, which integrates well with <a href='http://github.com/blog/553-looking-for-a-job-let-github-help'>Github Jobs</a></li>

<li>It currently suppots HTML, LaTeX, and Markdown. Soon it will support PDF, RTF, etc&#8230; I built this because I had to publish and start updating my resume again after not dealing with it for 3 years. I wanted something that would simplify the whole process. I wanted my resume under git, and I wanted to be able to quickly deploy any changes online and support a large number of formats. Anyways check out the <a href='http://github.com/danmayer/Resume'>source on Github</a> and the Readme which gives simple instructions on how to use the project. Or what the video below which demonstrates how to use this project for your own resume. Live Examples:- My <a href='http://resume.mayerdan.com'>resume on Heroku</a></li>

I try not to shrink it to the point that it is harder to read.

I don&#8217;t really have time right now to do a whole bunch, but when I saw <a href='http://ejohn.org/blog/processingjs/'>processing ported to javascript</a> I thought I really would have to write a visualization for at least one sort just for the fun of playing around with a cool project. So here is a link to my <a href='http://mayerdan.com/quicksort.html'>Quicksort in Processing.js</a>, it will only work in the very newest browsers (FF3, Opera 9.5, and other beta browsers&#8230; feel free to try it out on anything worst thing that will happen is just an empty box&#8230; but it will not likely do anything on older browsers).

I have a pretty good computer (3.4 ghz 1Gb ram), so I was confused when switching from WinAmp to iTunes to find my music randomly stalling. If i was running something process intensive like compiling or even just loading a new program my music would stutter on XP. I search around the web and found that others were having this problem, but not many had a good solution. After browsing around the web, I found that the stuttering in my music was caused when iTunes didn&#8217;t get enough of the CPU to process the music file. So when something would jump up and use 90% of my CPU iTunes would happily stop processing the music because it didn&#8217;t have a high enough process priority to keep a couple percent of CPU for itself. When playing music in the background iTunes only needs 3%-4% to play the music. So now knowing the problem I searched for solutions and many just said that every time they started iTunes they would open the Windows Task Manager go to the processes tab and right click on iTunes to set the priority of the process to high. This did in fact work, but now I had to do that every time that I openned iTunes which was really annoying. So I continued looking for a better solution. There are special windows programs out there, most of them cost money, that will monitor which processes are running on the system and automatically change the process priority on any app you tell the system to increase the priority to whatever settings you choose. This seemed like and OK solution but now having an app running all the time checking my processes and just some other app that could cause problems, seemed bad. It also seems that processes aren&#8217;t as stable if you switch their priority after they begin, it is best to set the priority as they are started. So off searching for a solution I found that you can start processes in does and pass what priority you want to start the process. So I decided to just hack up a little script which would launch iTunes from dos with a process priority of &#8216;High&#8217;. to run a windows app at a different process priority than the default you can create a file named &#8220;appName.bat&#8221; (in this case iTunes.bat), place this file in the same directory as the executable you want to run with a higher priority. Then edit the bat file (you can edit it in notepad). Add this line to the file start /high iTunes.exe (or start /priority_setting application.exe) Save your bat file&#8230; Now all you have to do is create shortcuts to the new bat file instead of the shortcuts pointing directly the application. To create a shortcut right click on your bat file and select &#8216;Create Shortcut&#8217;. If you want the shortcut to have the same icon as the original app instead of the dos icon, right click the shortcut and got to properties, then the &#8216;Shortcut&#8217; tab, and click Change Icon. Select browse an application to search for an icon in, then select the application you are creating a shortcut for (in this case iTunes.exe), it will display the available icons select the one your want. Anyways, I hope this helps anyone else having trouble getting audio to play smooth on windows XP with iTunes. I have also used this method to speed up some other processes that I always want running full speed on windows, with pretty good success.</p><mbp:pagebreak /><br/><hr/><a name='chap45' /><h3><a href='http://mayerdan.com/2008/01/20/online-resources-for-computer-science-students'>online resources for computer science students</a></h3><div>updated: 01/20/2008 at 12:00AM</div><br/><p><a href='http://www.virtualhosting.com/blog/2008/50-killer-online-resources-for-computer-science-students/'>50 killer online resources for computer science students</a>.

<p>It seems this was a pretty dumb, but probably mildly successful bot. It started some search and found tons of web pages, every time it encountered a form, it would attempt to fill out the majority of the fields with the URL hoping to make it into generated pages, most common search terms, comments, user names, or anything that would possibly link to the URL and increase the sites page rank. I found it hilarious, because somewhere on our site it was trying to fill out number, date, and other fields with the URL which we threw errors on format exceptions and probably returned them to the form with an error about that field.

Which is nice and saves lots of configuration. Unfortunately, I still need to get Subversion, Ruby, Tomcat, and other things installed and running on the system. Anyways since, I was going to have to set up a bunch of things and planned on using the system as a development machine I then installed Ubuntu desktop on the system as one of the aptitude scripts, which installs all the packages require for the desktop configuration. After that though, I realized that I was not able to complete any install with out causing an error in clvm, anything you install would cause a clvm error and make your install fail. So here is the fix if you install the Ubuntu server from CD and then install the desktop: Ultimately this post by npcomplete2000, was the solution for me:<a href='http://www.ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-186356.html'>http://www.ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-186356.html</a> removing clvm caused no problems for me and was something I never thought I would need.

If you have any problems or need more advanced XSTL this is also another very usefull <a href='http://www.zvon.org/xxl/XSLTutorial/Books/Output/example1_ch1.html'>set of XSTL examples</a>. The basic idea is to make the stylesheet so that it can sort and create a easy to view html table. Then you can either let excel open the XML which can find the stylesheet and apply it for the user, or you can use a program to do the conversion for your user and output excel or html files. I needed to generate the files for my users so I went with Xalan from the apache foundation. Xalan is a XSL stylesheet processors in Java &amp; C++ The example is simple to modify for whatever you need. I used the example file SimpleTransform, which can be found in the installation directory at <install>\xalan-j_2_6_0\samples\SimpleTransform    The result is simple and easy, below I will include my XSLT file to show how easy it is toe create simple large tables from a nice little XSLT file.

Many people say you shouldnt convert a string into an input stream and that it is bad code design though.

I will release the source soon, but I just wanted to comment on the lack of good documentation on the format that makes it very hard to work with the GNU tar format&#8230; Simple things like regular tar takes char 32 as a null and ignored character&#8230; and so does GNUtar for the regular tar fields but in the offset field needed for multi volume tars 32 crashes the program giving you header errors. It only accepts char 48 as a null which in the other size field it accepts either 32 or 48&#8230; things like this are commented no where and i only discoved by writting and editing the GNU tar source. Which is also far under documentated in the code and very hard to follow. GNU Tar size field: If your working with GNU tar the size field is just like the standard tar field in ustar&#8230; except which is no where to be found in their documentation when you support unlimited size files. If you have a file larger than 8GB to support it you must write the number as bits in twos compliment notation. Also after doing the you have to flip the sign bit (the very most left 0) to a 1. Which would normally mean you have a negative number and now if you decode this as a twos compliment you end up with a huge negative number&#8230; but not encoded it normally as a positive number and flip that bit. I only figured this out after manually reading and decoding gnu tar and stanttard ustar headers for a long time. The is nothing that talks about how the support for unlimited files was added to gnu tar&#8230; well hopefully if you are having the same problem you found this page. So upgrading GNU tar or other programs to support GNU tar should be easier. I have added support for these gnu features to javatar:Multi volumeverificationunlimited filesizefast single file extractionTar Table of contents (xml of the files and there offsets with in the tar) If your interested in this or have any questions about GNU tar or JAva tar feel free to send me an email and ask.</p><mbp:pagebreak /><br/><hr/><a name='chap87' /><h3><a href='http://mayerdan.com/2005/03/30/Java-Tar'>Java Tar</a></h3><div>updated: 03/30/2005 at 12:00AM</div><br/><p>Java Tar source.

<pre><code>  my error:C:\dev\dsmayer\sandbox\exe&gt;tar cvf tester.tar newstar: Cannot add file news: No such file or directory (ENOENT)tar: Error exit delayed from previous errors</code></pre>

<p>news was a standard directory. the error we found was occuring because we were in the <code>C:\dev\*.*</code> directory apparently dev and aux (as the other user was having that error) are some sort of key words that screw up the program, I dont know why. I do know that moving tar.ext and my directory to a folder <code>c:\temp</code> or any other <code>c:\*.*.\dsmayer\sandbox\exe</code> and it would work. So if your having any erros similiar with GNU tar I suggest changing directories and seeing if that fixes your problems. Taring under cygwin in this directory worked fine it was only a problem when taring in dos.

Also, I guess some of the Ideas are a little interesting. The code to run and test everything is provided in my extended entry if you want it. (The code isn&#8217;t the prettiest or well commented seeing as I had other work to do and had to finish the entire assignement in less than two days, but it works and the smart agent does do better thant he simple one.)</p>

<pre><code>Agents</code></pre>

<p>I created the two agents, the dumb agent that was mostly random and the more intelligent agent. The dumb agent got an avg of -450 which was close to the naive agent the professor had coded up, which averaged -390. So everything with my world and agent seemed pretty close. I then began work on the intelligent agent. I found it significantly harder than expected to add features that improved performance. Many times adding rules that I thought would help improve the agents performance and these rules would actually result in far lower scores. After trying a few pretty simple ideas I developed what my final agent became. My final agent had an average score of -60 which wasn&#8217;t great, but still significantly better than the dumb agent. I added one extra constraint to the game for fun, since I am a vegetarian I decided that I would never kill the Wumpus. So my algorithm would simple avoided the Wumpus in attempts to navigate to the gold. This lead to more impossible maps and therefor a lower overall score. It will still be interesting to see how my animal friendly agent performed in comparison to others.My more intelligent agent worked on the right hand on the maze wall idea. I would go forward until i found a area that could present a problem. A problem being either a stench or a breeze, if this problem was found i would turn around and walk the other direction and then try a different route, with my right hand facing the problem. This worked well at avoiding pits since I also had a higher percent of the time the choice of moving forward, and always would move forward if there was no chance of danger. This quickly lead to the problem of certain pits providing an infinite loop. Lowering my score by getting in a safe, but useless route. To fix this if I encountered the same pit problem multiple times i would then just walk threw the sensed breeze in hopes that the pit was not the direction I was going. This could have been improved by first trying alternate routes around the pit, but could have then left the problem of many different infinite loops.The improvement of the agent was significant and noticeable, but also illustrated the difficulties of simple relying on a simple set of rules. I think a more effective route would have been to have the agent slowly walk along any known safe route while mapping problem areas to his known portion of the map and only after exhausting all safe possibilities (and trying to create safe possibilities by killing the Wumpus) picking at random a unsafe point of passage that would lead to the most possible options for a next move.</p>

I have done lots of testing. I all of the categories (about 12) to an approximated error average of 88%. For 12 categories this is really good. First i began by adding more and more data to the categories and rebuilding the models. This initially was increasing the percents but it ceased to help after all of the categories had about 90 documents in them. I then began to play with the weight of the positive terms. This was highly successful after increasing the weighting on all of the positive training vectors I could successfully take all of the training data and recategorize it with 88% accuracy with the remaining documents not wrongly categorized but declared to be of an unknown category. I then started real world testing giving all of my category unseen documents that were hand categorized. The results for the few real world tests i have done so far have been fairly poor, showing only 15-20% accuracy. I am not sure why that varying how the model is made dramatically increases percent of categorization of known documents but seems to have no effect on unseen documents. This currently is the problem i am working on. It is possitive to get known values accuracy for my models to range from 85% to 93%. After a little more real world testing and some other discussion i might be able to come to a conclusion as to what is going on between known and unknown examples.</p><mbp:pagebreak /><br/><hr/><a name='chap99' /><h3><a href='http://mayerdan.com/2004/06/18/New-NewsShaker-Feature'>New NewsShaker Feature</a></h3><div>updated: 06/18/2004 at 12:00AM</div><br/><p>After waiting weeks of meaning to add this feature I finally did it. It actually took me less than an hour when I thought i was going to have to write all sorts of new code and that everthing would somehow end up being far more complex than I wanted it to be. Simple feature added, now instead of telling the system to crawl an entire site, you can tell the system to add a single page to the database. This makes it easier when finding an article, that links to entirely useless data, but should be added. So I am glad i finally took the time to add this simple feature. It was also good to see that I still remember alot more of the code structure on the spidering system than i would have thought I remembered. Starting next week I am going to finish making the system entirely automated. I should be able to finish that in a couple days. Then I am going to make the system very general so it doesn&#8217;t have to remain so specific to special education and then the same code base for newsshaker would be adoptable to other systems such as the HAMCOD project (which is a horrible name, but since I am more interested in just working on the idea for now I am not going to spend any time working on a name until success full.

It right now is just a initial idea and outline of an idea so that I have some thought to begin working with when I get to the next point. HAMCODHuman Assisted Machine Categorized Open Directory A collaborative human assisted machine categorized directory. That will extend the functionality of the ODP (http:www.dmoz.com) project. This project will combine a already large and extensive base of human knowledge, with text categorization and social collaboration techniques to increase the amount of well categorized and defined websites, without the need of such high levels of human interaction that are required for DMOZ. This projects goal is to eventually use machine learning techniques to replace the slow and time consuming process of human categorization. This will have humans interact with the machine learning process as it contributes to and works with the categorized directory. This will have humans say when something is miss categorized and they will be able to recommend new re-categorizations. Or recommend deletion from the directory. The spider would crawl for new pages that aren&#8217;t listed in the category, if a new page is discover by the spider, the system will attempt to categorize it to the lowest level of a category that it can. So if there is a main category like &#8220;shoes&#8221; it might have a hierarchy like this: 1.______Shoes____________________Car______________________Cheese2._________|________________________|_________________________|3.Nike___Reebok__Vans________Ford____Toyota_________American____Cheddar The system would first do categorization on the level of is this page about shoes. If it is determined to be about shoes it would them use different models knowing that it is a shoe to try to determine what shoe company the page is about. In its early stages it will only work through the Computers category of the DMOZ project. Which is already contains 149,512 websites. To first determine if a site belongs in the computers category, I will need to get about 400,000 websites at random from other parts of the DMOZ directory. Alternatively, I could assume that if I can&#8217;t find an appropriate sub category in computers that the site doesn&#8217;t belong in the computers category at all. Initially I will design the system with no log in or registration required. Since use will be practically non existent. Once use begins I will require an email address and to have that email address to be confirmed. This will make it rather hard for companies or individuals to artificially increase their rankings with in the directory. With in each category the sites will need some sort of ranking system initially I won&#8217;t worry about ranking the sites. I will just assume that as you get specific enough there will only be a small number of sites in each category. (This seems to be true for DMOZ)</p><mbp:pagebreak /><br/><hr/><a name='chap101' /><h3><a href='http://mayerdan.com/2004/06/16/Done-testing-and-work-on-SVMMail'>Done testing and work on SVMMail</a></h3><div>updated: 06/16/2004 at 12:00AM</div><br/><p>After going through a little less than 3000 emails.

I am sure this could be increased, but I need to move all of my focus back to my primary project, News Shaker. On the News Shaker front. I have added about 350 new manually categorized sites across the database. I am going to rebuild all of the models and see if the increased training data brings my percents up to a more reasonable level. Then once I have a little better percent accuracy I will begin all of the auto categorization code and just start to let the system go crazy and see how many sites it can categorize correctly when left to its own devices. Should be an interesting time next week. That is if the machine boots up. Someone was working on my system and now it freezes on boot up. I am sure all my data is still there and I have a fairly recent back up but hopefully this can be sorted out before the begining of next week.

So here is the first response I am posting on the web. Feel free to contact me if you have any other questions and I can try to respond. I found your project while googling for various alternatives to spamfiltering; I&#8217;ve been thinking about trying SVM for mail filtering myself,but I&#8217;m slightly at loss as to what features to use. A bag-of-words model comes naturally to mind, but it is not the mostefficient computationally; are you perhaps using it or something similar?First the text content is run through a common words stop list. This removes all very common and useless words when it comes to categorization. Removing words such as ?the?, ?is?, ?that?, and so on. Then the text is converted to the SVM format of feature vectors. The feature vectors are created using a relative frequency to the total word space. <b>Feature # : frequency in document / frequency in word space</b> So let?s say you have 3 documents in your space. All of the words in all of the documents would end up in your word space with a value of the total occurrences in all of the documents. Then a ratio for each document with the same word would be used for that feature. Each feature represents one word in the document. Lets do a tiny example: <b>Documents</b>1: ?There is a little cat?2: ?Where is the little cat?3:?There is a little dog, very little? <b>Space</b>There:2Where:1Is:2A:2Very:1The:1Little:4Cat:2Dog:1 So each of the words would be assigned a feature number in order of appearance, for instance ?There? would be 1 and ?Is? would be 2. Then to make the vector you would take each document and calculate the frequency ratio. For example we will do this for the 3rd document. There(1) : ? Is : ? a : ? Little: 2/4 Dog : 1/1 Very : 1/1 Replacing the words with their feature numbers and the fractions with values would result in the final document vector based on frequency. 1:.5 2:.5 3:.5 4:.5 5:1 6:1 You mentioned bag of words which is another way you can create vectors to represent the text. I thought about this method and decided that the frequency would provide a better representation of each document. Neither way is that computationally affective I guess. You can leave out all features with 0 since they will be ignored in SVM anyways. I also leave out all ratios that result in less than 0.000001 because I figure that means the feature is really worthless in comparison to the space. What makes this fairly efficient is that the dictionary with the word counts is saved. So while building the model is time consuming getting new text and making comparisons is really pretty fast. Then you don?t have to rebuild the model each time you place something in a category you can only rebuild as needed or on a set time like once a week. If you would like to see all of the libraries and math that I created to create these vectors download the source code to Text2SVM which I use to do these conversions. This also allows you to save a dictionary since each word must relate to the same feature value in the model and with any future files you plan to test against the model. This allows you to create new vectors that will match up with your old model.</p><mbp:pagebreak /><br/><hr/><a name='chap104' /><h3><a href='http://mayerdan.com/2004/05/19/SVMMail-vs-Apple-Mail'>SVMMail vs Apple Mail</a></h3><div>updated: 05/19/2004 at 12:00AM</div><br/><p>Well it looks like my SVM mail is very similar to apple&#8217;s Mail. Apples mail also uses a vector representation and training to achieve 98%+ accuracy (the claim). After reading through this, it makes sense why my filter is achieving such good accuracy. They are using a little more complicated vector analysis tool than I. I use SVMlight, while Apple is using LSA (Latentic Semantic Analysis), which i used to work with but I found the tools far less developed and harder to work with. It was causing me all sorts of problems to tell LSA to do the simple clustering I was doing very simple with SVMlight. The main reason it looks like they are using LSA is they first reduce the space vector and then using LSA on the reduced vector they are claiming a major performance increase. This is really believable, especially since LSA offers quick tools for folding new information into a model instead of recreating it. Anyways, I am happy to learn that the approach I took with my mail filter appears to be very similar to one of the best computer companies out there. It gives me even more reason to believe that I am on the right trail with all of my various Vector based learning algorithms. <a href='http://www.macdevcenter.com/pub/a/mac/2004/05/18/spam_pt2.html'>Explaining the Apple Mail Filter</a> P.S. This means that my filter that has barely been developed and has many enhancements possible is achieving about .5% less than apples filter!</p><mbp:pagebreak /><br/><hr/><a name='chap105' /><h3><a href='http://mayerdan.com/2004/05/18/News-Shaker-Update'>News Shaker Update</a></h3><div>updated: 05/18/2004 at 12:00AM</div><br/><p>After doing some initial work with the 8 category problem, I have run into some problems. Nothing that can?t be solved but just some initial hiccups as expected. The very first run through I was getting approximately 30% accuracy on my categorizations. Better than random guessing but still pretty worthless. After changing to a different layout of the model, I am now getting around 43%. Which 43% (on average of the 8 models some are higher) also sucks. I now have about 5 different ideas after talking with a professor at CU at how to improve my overall percents. I am trying to get over 75% accuracy once I have about that level (which isn?t that high) I am hoping with some user feedback on the site that the model will train and improve itself. Which would be really cool, and possible since pretty much the whole process is automated now. I first was taking all of the categories and creating a positive and a negative vector. The positive was all of the categorized data in the model. The negative was all of the other data in all the other categories. This wasn?t doing so well, so I removed the general category from the negative vector. I also removed the uncategorized data from the negative vector since it is possible these could fit in the category. Doing this increased my model accuracy from the 30% to the 43%. I am now considering other things I could do to improve the accuracy. One of the things I am considering is a two level model. The first would only say if the model relates to special education the second level would then categorize within the special education category. This would allow me to quickly dump anything I know isn?t related to special education at all. It would also allow me on the final site to have users help with the categorization process. Anything that couldn?t be categorized better than just special education related could be placed in a general category. The general category users could view and then place in the proper category which would in turn help train the system. I am also now considering a move from SVMlight to libSVM. Apparently libSVM offers some better options and optimizations, but still uses the same input format. This is important because text2SVM, took awhile and was written with SVMlight in mind. I have done some other optimizations on text2SVM which isn?t included in the released source because the project has begun to become less general and more specific to my project. It has improved and become far faster though. If I move to libSVM this would allow me to get results of a categorization attempt as a percent. If I had percents I could compare the results to different models better which would be useful since the value comparison between models isn?t scaled the same. One of the problems I am running into is testing time. It takes about 2 1/2 hours or so to create and run a new test. It requires a few different steps. If I run them all at once my machine runs out of memory and crashes. So I have to run the steps one at time even though the code is completely automated, it can?t run as such without time to dump the memory. Perhaps I will have to start looking around CU for a gigantic machine that I can use to do testing much faster. The spam filter has gone through over 500 emails now and has an accuracy of 97.5% on unseen new email. This is great, if it wasn?t so specialized to my mail I would make the filter available to everyone. That?s it for now. The good news is I think I am still headed in the right direction and I think I will end up with a capable system. The bad news is that I think it is going to be harder and more time consuming than originally planned. I will be busy with some other stuff and out of town over the next 3 weeks so there will probably be little updated information available on the project.</p><mbp:pagebreak /><br/><hr/><a name='chap106' /><h3><a href='http://mayerdan.com/2004/05/11/SVM-Mail-testing'>SVM Mail testing</a></h3><div>updated: 05/11/2004 at 12:00AM</div><br/><p>Today I got a chance to let SVM mail sort 252 messages that it has never seen before. The messages were moved sucessfully fromt he inbox to either my real folder, or my spam folder. Out of the 252 messages the system incorrectly categorized 8 emails. Three of the 8 were actually the same message sent out from the frienster network. I have added those messages to real training model. This means on the first really good real world test my filter achieved an 96.8% accuracy. This comparess well to the 98% estimated acuuracy of the model, by categorizing the training data 98% correctly. The system has been through about 400 emails, and my accuracy is now at 97.25 %. I have only retrained the model once including little bits of the new info I have collected. I places all of the incorrectly identified emails in the proper categories and retrained the system. Then just to see if that would make it correctly identify those emails I recategoried them, it cut the misclassifications in half, but some where still missclassified. It seems that forwarded messages with attachments are what it will missclassify still. Other emails seem good. I am currently not working on or extending this project because it was just a testing project for some of my code, which I am now focusing back on my News Shaker project, which is using SVM classification to create a google news like site.</p><mbp:pagebreak /><br/><hr/><a name='chap107' /><h3><a href='http://mayerdan.com/2004/05/07/SVMMail'>SVMMail</a></h3><div>updated: 05/07/2004 at 12:00AM</div><br/><p>I reached a great milestone with SVMMail today. I will be doing more test and releasing more information next week. The initial results are a 97% accuracy on the filter. Also with real world testing (so far a low number of 65 mails), there was only 2 errors (1 false positive) in prediction. I had training data of 550 real emails and 713 spam emails (all of which i collected in the 3 weeks or so that I ahve been working on this project.) I am really excited that I have past the stumbling blocks that I was on the last 3 days where I was actually getting a 0% accuracy because a bug the was generating a pretty much random model. There is currently no web interface and it is all just run directly from java (jbuilder in my case). I will add features like that and the ability to track how many of each type of error my system makes later. This is a great I am really happy with how this is working out.</p><mbp:pagebreak /><br/><hr/><a name='chap108' /><h3><a href='http://mayerdan.com/2004/04/18/SVM-Spam-Filtering'>SVM Spam Filtering</a></h3><div>updated: 04/18/2004 at 12:00AM</div><br/><p>Support Vector Machine (SVM) Spam filtering. After working more with SVM and my software to utilize it moving along nicely, I am begining to do work on a spam filter for my email. I have been getting a much larger amount of email in the last couple months. The spam is highly recognizable and simple to see patterns in, 90% of it is related to buying prescription drugs. I figured that SVM should be able to detected this very easily. Since i have already written, a few java email applications, I thought it would be easy enough to write a program that will let me log on and list things as spam and then use that to train and SVM model, which takes far less training data than many other machine learning methods. For now i have done a very simplistic design, the first step will, be building a simple webmail system, it will really only be used to mark as spam, and check the spam folder to make sure there was no false positives. Then I will use my normal mail system to read and respond to the mail. When i first log into my simple webmail all new mail will be download and categorized. I will then be able to submit any missed items as spam. Anything newly categorized as spam or not will be places in either the spam, or real mail section of the database. The database will store who the mail was from, the subject, and the body of the message. I have now created two folders in my mail system. old and spam. I have moved all my old real mail to the old folder and all spam to the spam folder. I have about 300 spam messages and about 520 real messages. I have finished hte code for the mail checking and sorting using java. I now imported my Text2SVM software and used the to create the orginal model file. Now similiarly to my NewShaker software all that is left to do is have autocategorization. For spam this should be a little simpler since there are only two classification levels. This should let me learn the process that I will need to use for Newsshaker, but at a little simpler level. I created a model using 170 of real mail, vs spam. With it I was getting an 80% recognition on my test data, I think with some simple fixes in the way I am creating my text from my mail, stop listing, and stemming I should be able to increase this rate. I should also be able to increase the rate once I add more training data. (This was created as a sub project to create and test code that will be used for newsshaker) <br />Here is my initial design.<br /><br /><a href='./gif_1.gif'><img alt='gif_1.gif' src='./gif_1-thumb.gif' /></a></p><mbp:pagebreak /><br/><hr/><a name='chap109' /><h3><a href='http://mayerdan.com/2004/04/13/Programming-progress'>Programming progress</a></h3><div>updated: 04/13/2004 at 12:00AM</div><br/><p>Today I accomplished alot on many different programming projects. 3 to be correct.

The only problem was half of the stuff i was doing by hand. I had written some java software Text2SVM toat would help witht he conversions and such, but i had to give it the names of the files and everything myself. I now integrated Text2SVM more into newsshaker. It uses the database to find out the names of all the categories. It recursively sorts through all the text files in given directories. It is quite nice. I ran into some problems where i was running the entire system out of memory even with a full gig given to java, which would cause way to much swapping and slow the hold system down. I rewrote my code to break up the steps into smaller parts using much less memory and it now doesnt crash and runs 2 or 3 times faster. I now can go straight from the database to 9 SVMlight formated text training datasets for models. The next step will be to write some code the generates the models using an interface between java and SVMlight. After that i will be writting some code to keep all the results of the testing organized and worthwhile, which i will be storing in the database. The final step will then be writting code that takes many random documents from my database and trys to categorize them, and stores if they were correctly told to be place in the category from which they came. I will then be storing a matrix of attempts to categorize a category and where it was actually categorized. This should be highly exciting because it will really let me see the info I need to know to make my system worka dn to know how reliably it works, and where the problems are occuring. It would let me for instants see if the space between special education parenting is to similiar and close to special education school to be determined, but if combined would serve as a valid and seperate categorization from everything else. School will probably keep me busy for awhile, but it is nice to be making some good progress and see a first beta version coming into very close view. Then i will have a wonderfull testing and development application for text categorization. Hopefully by the end of summer i will have everything generalized to the point that anyone could add categories and begin maintaining a category and seeing how they can get different results with different information retrival schemes, or using diffferent categorization algorythms besides SVMs. Anyone have some other algorythms worth looking into for text categorization, besides LSA/LSI and SVMs?</p><mbp:pagebreak /><br/><hr/><a name='chap111' /><h3><a href='http://mayerdan.com/2004/04/09/Busy'>Busy</a></h3><div>updated: 04/09/2004 at 12:00AM</div><br/><p>Alright i have been really busy on my senior project for the last couple weeks so I haven&#8217;t had time to really get any work done. I did however have a meeting with a CU AI professor who is familiar witht he use of SVMs. He thought i was on the right track and was approaching everything properly. He answered the one last question i had before i can really set the system up to start working on its own for categorization. So that was exciting. Now all i really need is a week or two to really spend some time coding. If i had the time i really think i could make a very impressive first run beta of the entire system. Then with some time i think it oculd turn into a pretty cool application. I am hoping to tweak some of the hard coded values to allow for much more flexability allowing hte system to be set up anywhere and work on categorizing any categories the user wants. The categories are currently hard coded into a few of the functions and in the end that wont be the best way to do things. Seperate good news is that my senior project just passed a 1 and 1/2 hour live test with 80 law students and a professor with no errors and no problems. That is the longest time the system has been used continously and by far the most users on the system at once. It is really kind of cool to think about the fact that their was 80 law students actively using something that i was a large part of creating. We are going to run a larger more extensive test on monday where the professor will be braodcasting a bunch of questions in class. We will see how that works out in the end, I am excited about it. The site will move soon, but if anyone is interested in looking at what my senior project can do take a look at <a href='http://blackout.cs.colorado.edu/mtroom3/jsp'>http://blackout.cs.colorado.edu/mtroom3/jsp</a> It is an interactive classroom for the law school, so that professors can more easily get feedback and quiz large classes of students. Finally a good friend of mine from my research lab was notice by google and they called her up to talk to her and ask for her resume. So that is some pretty exciting news, that they are actively searching out talent. Perhaps as my project matures they will stumble apon what i am doing.</p><mbp:pagebreak /><br/><hr/><a name='chap112' /><h3><a href='http://mayerdan.com/2004/03/30/FIRST-GOOD-SUCCESS'>FIRST GOOD SUCCESS!!</a></h3><div>updated: 03/30/2004 at 12:00AM</div><br/><p>Using my Text2SVM after learning how to increase java memory size so that i could do a large test was very successful.

They are a method or clustering and machine learning. In this examples we are working with Text categorization using SVM. This programs purpose is to take a bunch of documents in a category and a bunch of documents unrelated to that category. It then creates word vectors out of all the documents. The word vectors then are converted to SVMlights format and given positve weight and negative weight. Anytime the document vector has a possitive weight that means we consider it part of our category. A negative weight means it is outside of our category. After the text is written in this format you can use SVMlight to compare unknown text and see if it belongs in this category.

The first attempt was actually returning the .339 for one category and .328 for another. These were rather low. To improve the mean of the categories we thought creating a larger space with an overall larger vocabulary would help the documents to be more related. We increased the space from 987 total documents to 1798 documents. I didn&#8217;t add any documents to either of the test categories, only to the overall space (documents that were really not related to either catgory). I also added a simple stoplist filtering out some common but irrelavent words. This didn&#8217;t seem to help the relational mean between the two categories. The first category lowered from .339 to .320 while the second increased from .338 to .349. Now I have to decide wether to greatly increase the space, or greatly increase the documents within the categories (which i have to do by hand so it is a slow and time consuming process.)</p><mbp:pagebreak /><br/><hr/><a name='chap120' /><h3><a href='http://mayerdan.com/2004/03/01/Very-cool-clustering'>Very cool clustering</a></h3><div>updated: 03/01/2004 at 12:00AM</div><br/><p>This isn&#8217;t quite related to my own machine learning research but it is cool to see what others out there are doing with machine learning.

I will be setting up a collection of all the work and research that I have done on machine learning. I am working on a project for the L3D labs at the University of Colorado. I am working specifically with text categorization, currently focused on using LSA and SVM to categorize. I will post all the links, projects, examples, and resources that I have used and learned from during my progress on this project. This is documenting the work on my project <a href='http://clever.cs.colorado.edu:8080/newsShaker/jsp/index.jsp'>News Shaker</a>, which will be similiar to <a href='http://news.google.com/'>google news</a>. It uses a web spider and text categorization to organize the data into particular categories. The categories I am currently working with are special education related. The topics of the categories were choosen so that this project would become a sub project of <a href='http://www.web2gether.org'>Web2gether</a>, which is a site to help the special education community. Currently all of the categories seen on the News Shaker site are manually sorted and loaded into the system after the spider crawls specific topics on the web. I am now working with LSA and SVMs to begin the text categorization of newly crawled websites and results. This project is also setting up a easy to use web managed content management system. This would allow for the quick set up and design of any topic based categorization using the methods developed while creating the original News Shaker which is focused on special education.</p><mbp:pagebreak /><br/><hr/><a name='chap122' /><h3><a href='http://mayerdan.com/2004/02/16/open-gl-progress'>open gl progress</a></h3><div>updated: 02/16/2004 at 12:00AM</div><br/><p>Well first sorry about the site being down for awhile, my hosting service had some problems, but they have it fixed. Second, i finished my openGL project for fractal terrains today. This project took me entirely way to long, but it has been hard to move back to c++ after having all the nice things java provides you for so long. Anyways i am slowly getting back on track. So take a look and i hope you all like my little fractals. It is alot cooler if you actually have the program since you can rotate and do all sorts of stuff with the terrain then. Oh well back to laying and now moving. <img alt='openglfractal.jpg' src='http://WWW.bandddesigns.com/blogger/arch/openglfractal.jpg' /></p><mbp:pagebreak /><br/><hr/><a name='chap123' /><h3><a href='http://mayerdan.com/2004/02/02/finished-opengl'>finished opengl</a></h3><div>updated: 02/02/2004 at 12:00AM</div><br/><p>I just finished my first opengl progam. I know this one isn&#8217;t 3d but it could be. I just had a hard time moving back to c++ at first since i am so used to java and remembering all the wierd ways to pass things in c++ sucked. Anyways simple but wonderfull since i am done with my first working and well documentated opengl program. I think i have a good understanding of how to work with opengl now as well.

So now even if the server dies (since we really dont know what the problem was) i wont loose any work. My project at work it moving along nicely. Their are about 900 sites in the database currently and we should be categorizing on the fly by the end of this week. Which will be a huge step. If all goes well i might have a highly successfully project right away. If not with some refinement over a few weeks we should be able to make it fairly successful.</p><mbp:pagebreak /><br/><hr/><a name='chap125' /><h3><a href='http://mayerdan.com/2004/01/15/Cool-project'>Cool project</a></h3><div>updated: 01/15/2004 at 12:00AM</div><br/><p>I just learned that the final project in my computer graphics course is to make a simple 3d Doom like game. I am excited. Depending on the models and if we can make them or we are just using stock models I will try to put a bunch of my friends in the game so that I can kill them and they can all kill each other.

If you have any Java questions please feel free to post them if you think it is something I might be able to help you with. That said here is some java stuff&#8230; First off i think the best way to work with java code and projects is using J Builder. It is available free for personal use. I highly recommend it. It is available for linux and windows. get it from <a href='http://www.borland.com/jbuilder/'>Borland</a> If your going to develop web applications I also highly recommend apache tomcat. It is a free java (JSP) server. It is also available for both windows and linux which is great. get it from <a href='http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat/'>Apache Tomcat</a> If a java program keeps running out of memory, this is easy to fix. The java virtual machine is only given so much memory. So running:&#8221;java -Xmx256m PROGRAMNAME&#8221; should fix the problem by giving the virtual machine 256 mb of memory. You will see this error as a java.lang.outofmemory error. If your using J builder go to project-&gt;run-&gt;Java VM parameters: and add the -Xmx256m to the parameter line. Here&#8217;s how you could rewrite that statement using the ?: operator: System.out.println(&#8220;The character &#8221; + aChar + &#8221; is &#8221; + (Character.isUpperCase(aChar) ? &#8220;upper&#8221; : &#8220;lower&#8221;) + &#8220;case.&#8221;); The ?: operator returns the string &#8220;upper&#8221; if the isUpperCase method returns true. Otherwise, it returns the string &#8220;lower&#8221;. The result is concatenated with other parts of a message to be displayed. Using ?: makes sense here because the if statement is secondary to the call to the println method. Once you get used to this construct, it also makes the code easier to read. <b>Files:</b>One of the first Java projects I did the source and some info on a AOL Instant messenger (AIM) chatterbot. Built using simpleaim, megahal and some of my own work. Most of the work was in combining the programs learning how they worked and such though. I did add a nice logger to it as well. This still needs alot of work to be that impressive. download <a href='./files/MegaDan.zip'>MegaDan.zip</a> A part of my machine learning, for project News Shaker. Text2SVM converts text documents into the proper format for use with SVMlight. It is fairly well commented and contains the full source code.
